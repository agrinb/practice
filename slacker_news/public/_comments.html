        As an avid SoundCloud user I hope this doesn't happen. Twitter's past attempts at music have been terrible and I don't see why SoundCloud needs someone to acquire it. They're pretty much the default place for musicians (pro and amateur) to host their music and they have a decent way to monetise users.

           I agree. Being acquired by Twitter just makes it more likely that SoundCloud will fail, to me - have Twitter actually come up with a decent monetisation strategy yet?

                Well Twitter made about $665 million last year, with much larger projections for this year. I would say that qualifies as "decent".

                      Twitter lost $645 million in 2013. I'm not sure "spend $2 to make $1" necessarily qualifies as "decent".
